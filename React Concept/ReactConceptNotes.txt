
React JS Explained in 10 minutes 

    What is React 

        - React is a javascript library that is used to build User Interfaces 
        - Supplies tools to build UI's 
        - much faster and easier 


        SPA's (Single Page Applications)

            - uses a single template and keep modifying the template to make it seem like we have other pages 

        Components 
            - Visual layer of the UI
            - js class or function 

        JSX  (javascript xml)

            - gives added functionality 
            - similar to html 
            - class and event handlers are different 

        React Router (URL Router)

            - allows to have multiple templates in a single page 

        Props

            - passes data from one Component to another


        State (use state )

            - js object used to represent information about a component  

        Component life cycle (use effect)

            - 3 phases 

                Mounting - when added to dom
                updating - modifying 
                unmounting - when removed from dom 

        Hooks 

            - only apply to functional component 
            - let us add state and other features 
            - manage state ()

        State Management 
            - global states 

        Virtual DOM 
            - only updating places where there are changes 

        Key prop 

            - contain key 

        Event handlers 
             
             - camelcase and pass in the function directly 

        Forms 

             - add in event handlers whenever these change 

        Conditional rendering 

            - && ||

        Commands 

            - npx create-react-apply - creates react project 
            - npm start  - starts up dev server 
            - npm run build  - builds directory for production 

What is ReactJS -- ReactJS Basics 

    What is React?

        - is a js library fo rbuilding fast and interactive user interfaces for the web as well as mobile applications.
        - It is an open-source, reusable component-based front-end library 
        - In a model view controller architecture, React is the 'View' which is responsible for how the app looks and feels 
        - React was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook 

    Why React?

        - Easy creation of dynamic web apps 
        - Performance enhancements 
        - Reusable Components
        - Unidirectional data flow 
        - small learning curve 
        - can be used for mobile apps 
        - Dedicated tools for debugging

    Features of React

        - JSX
            - is a syntax extension to js. Itis used with react to describe what the ui should look like 
            - By using jsx, you can write HTML structures in the same file that contains js code 
            - JSX helps in making the code easier to understand and debug as it avoids usage of js DOM structures which are rather complex 
            - jsx = js + html 

        - Virtual DOM
            - represents the copy of the real DOM 
            - modifying real DOM is slower than virtual DOM 

        - Performance 
            - faster since components and virtual DOM is used 

        - One way data binding 
            - keeps data fast and modular 

        - Extensions 
            - has various extensions (native, flux)

        - Debugging 
            - easy to debug 

        - Components, State & Props 

            - components 

                    - building blocks 
                    - each component is gathered to make a bigger thing 
                    - reusable 

            - state 

                    - state of component is holder of data 
                    - if it changes it changes the state 

            - props 

                    - allow us to pass arguments 

    React Pre-requisites 

        - familiar with programming concepts (functions, objects, arrays, and classes )
        - js 
        - html
