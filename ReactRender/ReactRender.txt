Pre-requisites 

  - React Basics 

  - React Hooks 



Rendering in React 

  Rendering process 

  when a react code is run 

  - code in components translated into DOM 

  Two phases 

  i) Render Phase 

    1st render 

      - React starts at root and goes to leaf roots 
      - React executes createElement by converting jsx to javaScript objects 

      
    rerender 

        - starts at root and finds leaves that are flagged that have any change 
        - then react invokes createElement and converts jsx to javaScript   of the flagged components
        - then react will compare new render values with previous render values then a list will be made of all the changes that were resulted 


  ii) Commit Phase 

    1st render 

      - then all react elements are converted to DOM 


    rerender 

      - then react will get this list and changes the list of elements to the dom 


 Note: The commit phase is usually very fast, but rendering can be slow
